## About the Project
This project was developed in the Entra21 Node classes to improve my abilities in building REST APIs with Node.js and MySQL. It proposed to me my first time using the Sequelize ORM (Object Relational Mapper) in a project. It's not my first time building REST APIs with Node.js, so I would say that my biggest difficulty was the Sequelize syntax because of my limited experience with it, although it's an easy way to program using a relational database
